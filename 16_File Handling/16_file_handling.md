### 😔 **Temporary Pause - Back Soon!** 😔

Hey Rustaceans! 👋  
Due to some unforeseen laptop issues, I need to **temporarily pause our 30 Days of Rust challenge**. But don't worry – we’ve completed an exciting first half (15 days!), and I’ll tackle the remaining 15 days as soon as I’m back online! 🛠️

If you've enjoyed the journey so far, consider **supporting this project by giving it a star** – your support keeps the motivation strong! ⭐
